# WizardlyScripts
✨Homemade setups & scripts for whatever I even considered to write something and probably use it again ✨

TO-DO:
- Add better more iteration through all dependencies (rewrite it all to opensuse (and later let chatgpt to handle other distros))
- Export to ./.bashrc (custom shortcuts, custom commands for python projects (create new env & project), editor, other...)
- Setup GPU (download drivers, print info, etc...) script
- Rewrite python script for venv
- add more swiss knife functionalities (create custom)
